# Adding Materials to your Model

Using your icecream cone model from the last activity, let's take it to the next level by adding materials.

## Adding the colour to the Icecream Scoop

In the last activity, we conjoined the taurus and the UV sphere together to create the icecream scoop on top of the waffle cone. In this step we will cover how to make your icecream scoop whatever colour you'd like.

2. Click on the plus sign in the new window and choose "Add New Material". Navigate downward to where it says "Colour". Double click on the empty white bar next to colour and pick whatever colour you want. NOTE: You will not be able to see the colour on your icecream scoop just yet!

## Adding an image to the Waffle Cone

3. You will see
