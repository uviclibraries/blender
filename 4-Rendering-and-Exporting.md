# Rendering

## 1. Using the camera 

In Blender, every file you open typically has one camera and one light in it. These are two tools you can use for rendering or animation! Since we made a model, let's try rendering it. Rendering means converting your 3D model into a 2D image or animation!

1. Locate your camera by looking around your scene. Usually, your camera is somewhere near the center where the axis meet and should be composed of a rectangle and triangles. This is your camera. You can also locate it in the outliner on the right hand side of your viewport.

2. Your camera works similarly to a model in that you can rotate and move it around to cahange what it is capturing. Ideally, it would be nice for your camera to be pointing at your icecream cone so we can render an image of it. You can enter the camera view by **INSERT INSTRUCTIONS HERE**

3. Now, we are in the camera view and you can get a sense of where the camera is pointed. If you are unhappy with the angle, go back out of the camera view and select the "rotate", "view" or "scale" options to adjust your camera until you have figured out an angle in which you can see your whole icecream cone. Make sure to intermittedly check the camera view as you adjust.   

## 2. Using the light 

Once you have found a camera angle that you are satisfied with, it's time to change where the light is located. Treat your light as a real light source. If your light is behind your model and the camera is in front of your model, your model is going to be backlit. If the light is also in front of the model by the camera, there is going to be a lot of light on the model. 

1. Adjust the light as you did with the camera. Selecting the light by clicking on the light in your scene or in the outliner and then using the "move" or "scale" option to place it where you want. I suggest for this activity, placing the light either directly above or beside where the camera is so that there is a lot of light shining on the object for the render.

## 3. Rendering a 2D image of your model

Now it is time to render your 2D image!
