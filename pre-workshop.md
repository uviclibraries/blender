## Pre-Workshop Videos & Activities
This workshop is primarily hands-on practice with Blender in order to learn to use key features of the software. To participate fully please do the following **before the workshop**:

Navigate to the [Blender Website] and download Blender. This may take a bit so make sure to do this **beforehand**.
This Blender workshop is catered towards those who have access to a mouse and keyboard. Blender is useable without a mouse but is significnatly more difficult and the instructions we have here will not be helpful.  

**put videos for examples**
